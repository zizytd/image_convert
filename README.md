# image_convert
This repo has two scripts, a bash and a python script
The bash script downloads a zip file from the internet called images.zip and unzips it after the dowload and finally creates a new folder imaged.
The python script copies the files in the images folder to a new folder, resizes the files, rotate the files to a degree of 270 and converts the file from tiff format to jpeg.
